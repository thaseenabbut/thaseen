# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!  

Iâ€™m **Thaseen**, a developer passionate about building tools that make communities better. My main focus is **JavaScript**, but I also explore other technologies as I learn and grow.  

Currently, Iâ€™m developing **[LazaBot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=938803094291116082)**,  
an all-in-one Discord management bot designed to simplify moderation, engagement, and server utilities.  

Most of my projects are community-focused, aiming to improve the Discord experience through clean design and reliable features.
